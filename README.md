# CPU Caching System Simulation

Cache is a component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. Recently or frequently used data are stored temporarily in the cache to speed up the retrieval of the data by reducing the time needed for accessing cache clients data such as the CPU.

This project is a simulation of the caching system with 3 different mapping techniques:
1. Fully Associative
2. Direct Mapping
3. Set Associative

## Technologies Used

- Prolog
- Haskell
